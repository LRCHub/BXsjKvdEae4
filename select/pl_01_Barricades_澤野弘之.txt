Wouldn't it be nice to take a
walk on some pure white sand
Gaze at the horizon without
living in fear
Wouldn't be sweet to watch the
sun curve down meets the waves
And taste the ocean spray
And realize we'd been living as
slaves
We've got to learn to get back,
get back
But is it worth the price of our
soul
You know you had to kill her,
kill her
Oh my dirty hands it never fades
And if we get out, get out
I'll think about the price of
our soul
We've got to learn to live free,
live free
We'll live a life without
barricades
Wow oh~ oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh~ oh oh oh oh oh ohoh
Wow oh~ oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh~ oh oh oh oh oh ohoh
How long I haven't seen the
light shine through in my life
Lost everything, family,
confusion on the way
Someone tries to talk to me and
signpost the righteous road
My animal inside
Can now be tamed to go over the
wall
We've got to learn to get back,
get back
But is it worth the price of our
soul
You know you had to kill her,
kill her
Oh my dirty hands it never fades
And if we get out, get out
I'll think about the price of
our soul
We've got to learn to live free,
live free
We'll live a life without
barricades
Wow oh~ oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh~ oh oh oh oh oh ohoh
Wow oh~ oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh~ oh oh oh oh oh ohoh
We've got to learn to get back,
get back
But is it worth the price of our
soul
You know you had to kill her,
kill her
Oh my dirty hands it never fades
And if we get out, get out
I'll think about the price of
our soul
We've got to learn to live free,
live free
We'll live a life without
barricades
Wow oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohoh
Wow oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohoh
