Wouldn't it be nice to take a walk
On some pure white sand
Gaze at the horizon
Without living in fear?

Wouldn't it be sweet to watch the sun curve
Down meet the waves?
And taste the ocean spray
And realize we've been living as slaves

We've got to learn to get back, get back
But is it worth the price of our soul?
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
Oh my dirty hands
It never fades

And if we get out, get out
I'll think about the price of our soul
We've got to learn to live free, live free
We'll live a life without barricades

Woah!
Woah!
Woah!

Woah!

How long I haven't seen the light shine through
In my life?
Lost everything
Family, confusion on the way

Someone tries to talk to me
And signpost the righteous road
My animal inside
Can now be tamed to go over the wall

We've got to learn to get back, get back
But is it worth the price of our soul?
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
Oh my dirty hands
It never fades

And if we get out, get out
I'll think about the price of our soul
We've got to learn to live free, live free
We'll live a life without barricades

Woah!
Woah!
Woah!
Woah!

We've got to learn to get back, get back
But is it worth the price of our soul?
You know you had to kill her, kill her!
Oh my dirty hands
It never fades

And if we get out, get out
I'll think about the price of our soul
We've got to learn to live free, live free
We'll live a life without barricades

Woah!
Woah!
Woah!
Woah!
