Mother doesn't know where love has gone
I see a little face that's turned to ice
And now I know what they're saying as our sun begins to fade

Father made my history
He taught me what to say in school
And now I know what they're saying in the music of the parade

Born on different sides of life
But we feel the same and feel all of this strife
And now I know what they're saying as the drums begin to fade

Oh, turn around and I'll be there
Oh, I thought we were the human race but we were just another borderline case
Oh, I don't know where love has gone
Friday's child is full of soul
And now I know what they're saying
It's a terrible beauty we've made
And now I know what they're saying as our hearts go to their graves
