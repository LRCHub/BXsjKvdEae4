[00:37.18] Wouldn't it be nice to take a walk on some pure white sand
[00:41.83] Gaze at the horizon
[00:44.03] Without living in fear?
[00:46.28] Wouldn't it be sweet to watch the sun curve down meets the waves?
[00:51.36] And taste the ocean spray
[00:53.52] And realize we'd been living as slaves
[01:12.52] 
[00:59.17] We're gonna let it
[01:00.02] Get back, get back
[01:01.46] But is it worth the price of our soul?
[01:03.60] You know you had to
[01:04.77] Kill her, kill her!
[01:06.23] Oh my dirty hands
[01:07.76] It never fades
[01:08.76] And if we
[01:09.41] Get out, get out
[01:10.80] I'll think about the price of our soul
[01:12.63] We've got to learn to
[01:13.52] Live free, live free
[01:15.17] We'll live a life without barricades
[01:33.17] 
[01:41.22] How long I haven't seen the light
[01:43.73] Shine through in my life
[01:45.74] Lost everything
[01:47.13] Family, confusion on the way
[01:50.39] Someone tries to talk to me
[01:52.29] And signpost the righteous road
[01:55.49] My animal inside
[01:57.66] Can now be tamed to go
[01:59.26] Over the wall
[02:05.76] 
[02:03.13] We're gonna let it
[02:04.04] Get back, get back
[02:05.34] But is it worth the price of our soul?
[02:07.52] You know you had to
[02:08.47] Kill her, kill her!
[02:10.48] Oh my dirty hands
[02:11.50] It never fades
[02:12.54] And if we
[02:13.10] Get out, get out
[02:14.47] I'll think about the price of our soul
[02:16.96] We've got to learn to
[02:17.77] Live free, live free
[02:19.07] We'll live a life without barricades
[02:37.07] 
[02:57.73] We're gonna let it
[02:58.70] Get back, get back
[03:00.23] But is it worth the price of our soul?
[03:02.40] You know you had to
[03:03.22] Kill her, kill her!
[03:05.23] Oh my dirty hands
[03:06.34] It never fades
[03:07.34] And if we
[03:07.91] Get out, get out
[03:09.36] I'll think about the price of our soul
[03:11.58] We've got to learn to
[03:12.66] Live free, live free
[03:13.99] We'll live a life without barricades
